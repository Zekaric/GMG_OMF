<h1 class="zword"><a name="1">1 - About</a></h1>
<p class="zword"><a href="https://github.com/gmggroup/omf">GMG OMF</a> is the official library but this was developed using python. Which is fine but for me and many other devlopers a python library is a hurdle that is hard to jump over since a lot of us have codebases in C/C++/C# or other similar language where python is not a good fit.</p>
<p class="zword">I am developing in C to make it the easiest for others to port to any other language. This is where C still shines when compared to C++. Eventually C++ will get there, or maybe RUST but until then I am sticking with C.</p>
<p class="zword">Will this become the official native library for OMF? Time will tell but I am currently writing this with no expectation of this being adopted as the official library for OMF. I am doing this because there is no implementation in C++ or C at this time. And I agree with the goal of OMF format to make interchange of data between software easier. That will not happen until a native library like this exists.</p>
<p class="zword">I will make every effort to make compliant OMF files and not cause incompatibilities with the official reference Python library.</p>


<h1 class="zword"><a name="2">2 - Licence</a></h1>
<p class="zword">MIT.  I do not expect this to ever change. The goal is to make this as easy to adopt and integrate into various software systems. The License then needs to make that possible and the MIT license is one of those licenses.</p>


<h1 class="zword"><a name="3">3 - Contact</a></h1>
<p class="zword">I am Robbert de Groot.  Currently the sole developer on this project.</p>
<p class="zword">I can be reached off of github at "zekaric (at) gmail.com" or at <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/zekaric">Linked In</a></p>

<p class="zword">I work for Hexagon (Hexagon Mining devision.) I have been in software devlopement professionally since 1995 (Initially Mintec, Inc. which was bought by Hexagon in 2014) and have been primarily programming in C and C++ on their flagship product MinePlan 3D (previously known as MineSight 3D.)  Even though I work for Hexagon, Hexagon is not in any way funding or directing this work.  This work is being performed on my time outside of official work hours.  This work is also not being funded or directed by GMG, the official developers/designers of OMF.  If any of this changes in the future, I will make it clear what those changes will be.</p>
