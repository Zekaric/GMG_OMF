# libOMF_C

https://github.com/gmggroup/omf is the official library but this was developed using python.  
Which is fine but for me and many other devlopers a python library is a hurdle that is hard
to jump over since a lot of us have codebases in C/C++/C# or other similar language where 
python is not a good fit.

I am developing in C to make it the easiest for others to port to any other language.  This
is where C still shines when compared to C++.  Eventually C++ will get there, or maybe RUST 
but until then I am sticking with C.

Will this become the official native library for OMF?  Time will tell but I am currently 
writing this with no expectation of this being adopted as the official library for OMF.  I
am doing this because there is no implementation in C++ or C at this time.  And I agree with
the goal of OMF format to make interchange of data between software easier.  That will not 
happen until a native library like this exists.  

I will make every effort to make compliant OMF files and not cause incompatibilities with
the official reference Python library.
